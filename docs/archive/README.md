## Why Archive?

These documents were archived because:
- Content has been consolidated into core documents
- Information was redundant or outdated
- Documents were specific to development phases that are complete
- Validation reports are no longer needed after successful implementation

## Accessing Archived Content

If you need information from these archived documents:
1. Check the core documentation first - most content has been preserved
2. Review the specific archived file if historical context is needed
3. Contact the development team if you cannot find what you need
