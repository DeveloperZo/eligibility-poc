## Problem Statement

Organizations managing employee benefits face significant challenges in eligibility determination:
- **Complex Rule Management**: Multiple eligibility criteria across different benefit plans require constant updates and maintenance
- **IT Dependency**: Business users must rely on IT teams for any rule changes, creating bottlenecks and delays
- **Lack of Standardization**: Inconsistent rule evaluation logic across different systems leads to errors and compliance risks
- **Limited Agility**: Changes to benefit plans can take weeks or months to implement through traditional development cycles

## Solution Overview

The benefit plan Management System empowers business users with complete autonomy over benefit plan benefit plans through a modern, self-service platform. By leveraging industry-standard decision management technology (Camunda DMN) combined with an intuitive user interface (Retool), the system transforms how organizations manage and evaluate eligibility criteria.
